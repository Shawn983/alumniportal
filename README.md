The Alumni Management System is a dynamic web application designed to connect and engage alumni by providing a digital platform where they can interact, share updates, and collaborate. This platform facilitates an alumni directory, event scheduling, and a newsfeed for announcements, enhancing the community engagement among graduates. Additionally, it supports user authentication and encryption of user credentials under the register and login function. With collaboration features, it allows alumni to connect with each other for various opportunities and initiatives. The application is built using Flask for the webapp, PostgreSQL for data management on the database, and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend deployment, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience. Deployed on Render, it leverages powerful server-client architecture for a robust deployment.
